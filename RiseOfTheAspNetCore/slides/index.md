###XSP / ASP+
_"We originally called it XSP; and people would always ask what the X stood for. At the time it really didn't stand for anything. XML started with that; XSLT started with that. Everything cool seemed to start with an X, so that's what we originally named it. In the first six months, we didn't use .NET. The CLR didn't exist—it was just starting around the same time we were—so, we were doing most of our prototyping in C++, JavaScript, and ActiveScript script engines. We knew we wanted an object-oriented environment, and we really liked the characteristics a managed programming model provided in terms of garbage collection, nice encapsulation, and object-orientation techniques..._

---

_... We actually started writing production code in C++, though, because at the time we didn't really have a good runtime platform on which to build. We got about two weeks into it when we met up with the CLR team; at the time that team had no partners inside the company building on top of them. The only compiler they had was this thing called "simple managed C," which we affectionately called "smack." We ended up saying, "Maybe we should build on this." It was a huge risk, and at the time our team consisted of three or four people total. We were allowed to take a bet on it mainly because nobody really cared if we failed. Thankfully, we did and it paid off in a huge way. The rest is history, so to speak."_

___Scott Guthrie, co creator of ASP.NET___
